1 About me
---------------
Square city map was created due to the lack of useful and functional tutorials for OpenTTD. In Readme you will find everything you need to understand and learn to play OpenTTD.
So I won't stay any longer and we'll jump on the tips and progress of the map so you can finally go play it.
 
2.1 Requirements
-----------------
-In order to play this map, you will need OpenTTD 1.10.3 and higher
-You can't play in TTDpatch
2.2 Installation
-In the meantime, you must download the zip file and insert it into the scenarios folder in the OpenTTD folder
-In the future, I want to put directly in the OTTD Online content in the game.
2.3 Shutting down trees and others
--------------------------------
-In order not to see the trees or the names of cities and stations, you must go to Settings then select the transparency settings as shown in the Picture n.4
-When you click only on the icon, the trees, houses, bridges or industries will turn black and partially disappear, but if you click on the green rectangle the object will disappear completely.




3.1 Tips :
---------------
1. Use all modes of transport, it is not always possible to use the train
2. Try not to use the terrain adjustment (it can be finished without it :))
3. Try to use both bridges and tunnels.
4. I recommend making a backbone for your trains that will lead through entire map.
5.



3.2 The course of the game:
----------------------------
1. Take the maximum loan
2. Try to connect the coal mine with the power plant or the forest with the saw, earns the most: D .
3. Try to build something similar to Picture n.1
4. Continue to Picture n.2 and then buy a engine with the highest reliability and 7 wagons for either wood or coal at the depot, depending on what you have chosen.
5. Click on the train and then on the button in Picture n.3
6. Then click on the button to add a station and click on the station closer to the coal, then do the same at the other station
7. After the seventh step, go to the depot and click on the button to clone the train
8. Hold the CTRL and click on the train you want to copy. If you ever change commands, you will not have to change them for each train.
9. I recommend building bridges in a similar style as in picture no. 4
10. Then just expand your empire to other islands and buy more vehicles.
